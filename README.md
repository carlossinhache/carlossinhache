<p>and the universe said I love you</p>
<p>and the universe said you have played the game well</p>
<p>and the universe said everything you need is within you</p>
<p>and the universe said you are stronger than you know</p>
<p>and the universe said you are the daylight</p>
<p>and the universe said you are the night</p>
<p>and the universe said the darkness you fight is within you</p>
<p>and the universe said the light you seek is within you</p>
<p>and the universe said you are not alone</p>
<p>and the universe said you are not separate from every other thing</p>
<p>and the universe said you are the universe tasting itself, talking to itself, reading its own code</p>
<p>and the universe said I love you because you are love.</p>
<p>And the game was over and the player woke up from the dream. And the player began a new dream. And the player dreamed again, dreamed better. And the player was the universe. And the player was love.</p>
<p align="center">You are the player.</p>
<p align="center">Wake up.</p>
